### Hello, my name is Maria Mariah, but you can just call me Mariah! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· A brazilian girl! From Porto Alegre - Rio Grande do Sul; But living in ArmaÃ§Ã£o dos BÃºzios - Rio de Janeiro.
- ðŸŽ“ I started the Systems Analysis and Development at "Gran Faculdade" in Jun/2024. Expected completion date: Jan/2027.
- ðŸ¦» I was born at 6 months and weighed 870g. I have Bilateral Sensorineural Hearing Impairment 
(I can hear without using hearing aids, but high-pitched sounds and phonemes are very difficult for me to hear).
- ðŸ’» In addition to what I'm learning at University, I always look for other courses on my own to gain more knowledge.
I am very enthusiastic about the programming languages â€‹â€‹C, C++, C#. Maybe Java and Python in the future. 
These are languages â€‹â€‹that I intend to learn in addition to the university content.
